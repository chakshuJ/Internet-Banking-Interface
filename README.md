# Internet-Banking-Interface
An attempt to make internet banking user friendly for semi-literate, illiterate people.

In this article, we have presented a user interface for internet banking with qualities and features enabling semi-literate and
illiterate subjects use internet banking without trust issue, need no interference of the third person to make him complete his online transaction. These includes features such as graphical icons, voice feedback on all functional units, and active visual
response on mouseover, but also thus far unnoted features such as semi-abstracted, instead of purely iconic graphics. With an additional feature of face recognition as an alternative method to authenticate the user instead of using usual user entering passwords. While we are not yet at a point where we have achieved the goal of a truly assistance-less user interface for novice, illiterate user, we believe this work takes us one step closer.
